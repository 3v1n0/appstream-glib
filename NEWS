Version 0.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2014-03-26

Notes:
 - This release adds basic Ubuntu app-install support, speeds up the time taken
   to parse large metadata files and reduces the amount of memory used to load
   the AppStream metadata.

New Features:
 - Add as_app_parse_file() which parses a .desktop file into an AsApp
 - Add as_node_get_tag() and only store the name when the tag is unknown
 - Add as_node_take_attribute() to reduce allocations during parse
 - Add as_store_load() to load system and user locations
 - Add as_tag_from_string_full() to control whether fallback names are used
 - Load the Ubuntu app-install data which uses screenshots.debian.net
 - Use gperf to generate a perfect hash for the tag names

Bugfixes:
 - Do not use GHashTable to store node attributes
 - Reduce the number of small attr key allocations
 - Use the full ID for the AsStore hash
